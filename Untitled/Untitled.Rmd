You answered question `r student$question`.

## Categories

```{r}
# set order and translation of criteria columns
# exact column header names = names to display in the table
cols <- list(
  "KR" = "Knowledge and Research",
  "CE" = "Critical Evaluation",
  "AC" = "Academic Communication"
)

# set order and translation of category labels
# category values = labels to display in the table
cats <- list(
  "1" = "Needs Work",
  "2" = "Acceptable",
  "3" = "Good",
  "4" = "Outstanding"
)

# create table for this student
category_table(student, cols, cats)
```

### Distribution of Marks

```{r, fig.alt="A plot showing the distribution of marks for questions A and B. "}
# you can create plots dynamically
mark_dist(marks, "grade", facet_by = "question", 
          scale = c("E", "D", "C", "B", "A"))
```

```{r, fig.align='right', out.width="25%", fig.alt="#psyTeachR logo in rainbow colours with the words Reproducible and Research after the R"}
# if the same images are used in many files 
# it is better to save them and reference like this:
knitr::include_graphics("https://psyteachr.github.io/images/psyTeachR_logo.png")
```
